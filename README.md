////////////////////////////////////////
The general idea the look and the interactivity of my quiz app
///////////////////////////////////////


this will be a quiz game made using purly javascript, html, and css. 
=============
my goal is to create a game that askes the user questions on differnt topics. 
=================
if the user inputs the correct answer they will be given a point if the user inputs the wrong answer they dont recieve a 
point.
===================
there will be a score keeper modal and start and quit buttons.
i want it to be colorful and interactive.
=================== 
When the page loads there will be a dialoge box with a start button. when the user clicks start the dialog will disappear and the first questions and answer choices will appear in a card format.
=====================
i will use css to make the animations for the cards. the back ground to change colors based on right or wrong answers.
========================
When the user choses a wrong answer. the dialoge box will shake and the background will turn red. after that the next button will appear
===========================
If the user choses a correct answer the dialog box will have bright green border and the background of the page will turn green.
